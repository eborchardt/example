    In your terminal, navigate to the directory containing both the "Makefile" and "hello.c" files.

    To compile the program, simply run the make command:

bash

make

The make command will use the instructions in the Makefile to compile your "Hello, World!" program.

    To run the program, use the following command:

bash

./hello

You should see the output "Hello, World!" displayed in the terminal.

    To clean up and remove the generated executable, you can use the following command:

bash

make clean

That's it! You've created a "Hello, World!" program using a Makefile and the make command with GCC.
